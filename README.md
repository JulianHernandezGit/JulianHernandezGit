 - Making projects with Express. 
 - NodeJS. 
 - HTML5 + CSS3. Flexbox. 
 - Scrum Methodology. 
 - Deploying to Heroku. 
 - Responsive web design. 
 - Git, Github. 
 - Wireframing. 
 - MVC Arquitecture.
 - And more!

📖 And, what's next?
 - Front-End JavaScript. 
 - Databases.
 - APIs
 - React.
 - Final project: Create a full functional E-Commerce.

🛠️ I have almost 8 years working as an Account Executive / Account Manager, KAM/B2B specialist.

🎸 Music is my big passion! I have my own recording studio, and I´m the writer and composer of a Hip Hop Fusion group.
